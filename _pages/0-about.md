I am an ECE PhD student at <a href="https://sinrg.csl.illinois.edu/"> Signals and Inference Research Group (SiNRG)</a>, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC) working under the guidance of <a href="https://croy.web.engr.illinois.edu/">Prof. Romit Roy Choudhury</a>.
</p>

I worked as a Research Fellow at <a href="http://www.leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/"> LEAP Lab </a>, <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Science </a> under <a href="http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/">Prof. Sriram Ganapathy</a>. During my time at LEAP lab I focused my research on learning useful and interpretable audio representations. My work on filter-bank learning for interpretable audio front-end design for acoustic scene classification is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14793">here</a>. A more recent work focuses on desiging learnable filter-bank for COVID-19 diagnosis. I was also associated with projects involving accent adaptation for ASR and far-field speech enhancement.
