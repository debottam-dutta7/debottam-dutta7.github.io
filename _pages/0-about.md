    I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by
    <a href="https://croy.web.engr.illinois.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Romit Roy Choudhury</a> in the
    <a href="https://sinrg.csl.illinois.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Signals and Inference Research Group (SiNRG)</a>.
    My research centers on <strong>generative and diffusion-based models</strong> with an emphasis on
    <strong>compositional generation, controllable synthesis and robustness</strong>. I explore how diffusion models
    represent and combine multiple visual or semantic concepts, and how corrective or guided sampling can improve their
    alignment and reliability.
  </p>

 <p>
    Before my Ph.D., I worked as a Research Fellow at the
    <a href="http://www.leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LEAP Lab</a> at 
    <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indian Institute of Science</a>, advised by
    <a href="http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Sriram Ganapathy</a>, where I studied
    representation learning and interpretability for audio and speech.
  </p>
  <p>
    Across both domains, my broader goal is to develop
    <strong>robust and controllable generative models</strong> that can compose multiple concepts coherently and generalize
    across modalities.
