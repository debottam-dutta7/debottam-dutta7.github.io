<p>
I am a 3rd year ECE PhD student at <a href="https://sinrg.csl.illinois.edu/"> Signals and Inference Research Group (SiNRG)</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://croy.web.engr.illinois.edu/"> Prof. Romit Roy Choudhury</a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of generative models and their applications to Audio and Images.
</p>

Prior to joining PhD, I worked as a Research Fellow at <a href="http://www.leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/"> LEAP Lab</a>, <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Science </a> under <a href="http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/">Prof. Sriram Ganapathy</a>. During that time, I mostly focused on learning useful and interpretable audio representations tailored towards different downstream tasks.
