<p>
I will be starting as an ECE PhD student at <a href="https://synrg.csl.illinois.edu/earables.html#home">SyNRG </a>, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC) this fall  under the guidance of <a href="https://croy.web.engr.illinois.edu/">Prof. Romit Roy Choudhury</a>.
</p>

I worked as a Senior Research Fellow at <a href="http://www.leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/"> LEAP Lab </a>, IISc under <a href="http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/">Prof. Sriram Ganapathy</a>. During my time at LEAP lab I focused my research on learning useful and interpretable audio representations. My work on filter-bank learning for interpretable audio front-end design for acoustic scence classification is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14793">here</a>. A more recent work focuses on desiging learnable filter-bank for COVID-19 diagnosis. I was also associated with projects involving accent adaptation for ASR and far-field speech enhancement.
