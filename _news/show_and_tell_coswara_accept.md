Show and tell paper titled *"Coswara: A website application enabling COVID-19 screening by analysing respiratory sound samples and health symptoms"* got accepted at Interspeech2022. This paper describes a tool, a web-site application designed to enable COVID-19 detection by
analysing respiratory sound samples and health symptoms. A
user using this service can log into a website using any device
connected to the internet, provide current health symptom information and record a few sound samples corresponding
to breathing, cough, and speech. Within a minute of analysis of
this information on a cloud server the website tool will output
a COVID-19 probability score to the user.
