  abstract = "This paper presents the Coswara dataset, a dataset containing
              diverse set of respiratory sounds and rich meta-data, recorded
              between April-2020 and February-2022 from 2635 individuals (1819
              SARS-CoV-2 negative, 674 positive, and 142 recovered subjects).
              The respiratory sounds contained nine sound categories associated
              with variants of breathing, cough and speech. The rich metadata
              contained demographic information associated with age, gender and
              geographic location, as well as the health information relating
              to the symptoms, pre-existing respiratory ailments, comorbidity
              and SARS-CoV-2 test status. Our study is the first of its kind to
              manually annotate the audio quality of the entire dataset
              (amounting to 65 hours) through manual listening. The paper
              summarizes the data collection procedure, demographic, symptoms
              and audio data information. A COVID-19 classifier based on
              bi-directional long short-term (BLSTM) architecture, is trained
              and evaluated on the different population sub-groups contained in
              the dataset to understand the bias/fairness of the model. This
              enabled the analysis of the impact of gender, geographic
              location, date of recording, and language proficiency on the
              COVID-19 detection performance.",
